	<h1>Design to Manufacturing and Inspection (D2MI)</h1>

	<p>The Design to Manufacturing and Inspection project demonstrated the feasibility and development of CAD-to-CAM and CAD-to-CMM tools taking advantage of the 3D data interoperability groundwork previously established with CAD-to-CAD. The enhanced interoperability will significantly reduce and/or eliminate recreation of part design data, reduced cycle time and cost, reduce risk of downstream error introduction, increased part yield, and generate higher quality products.</p>
	
	<p>The information flow utilized a CAD model with PMI that is translated from native CAD to STEP. The STEP file was then imported by the CAM system, which uses a Parasolid kernel. In addition, the STEP file was ported to an extended version of ACIS that was imported by the CMM system, which uses an ACIS kernel.</p>

	<p>The project tasks included:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Proof-of-Concept demonstrator for transport of PMI downstream to manufacturing and First Article Inspections (FAI)</li>
		<li>Identify Metrics for analyzing As-Is and To-Be processes</li>
		<li>Collect Metrics results for As-Is and To-Be processes and determine Return On Investment (ROI)</li>
		<li>Identify technology and data gaps and roadblocks in the To-Be process</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The project was a collaborative effort by a team comprised of <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>, <a href="https://www.iti-global.com/">ITI TranscenData</a>, <a href="https://www.rockwellcollins.com/">Rockwell Collins</a>, <a href="https://www.coretechnologie.com/">CT CoreTechnologie</a>, <a href="http://www.accr-llc.com/">Advanced Collaboration Consulting Resources LLC</a>, <a href="https://www.mastercam.com/en-us/">CNC Software Inc.</a>, <a href="https://www.mitutoyo.com/">Mitutoyo America Corp.</a>, and <a href="http://www.geater.com/">Geater Machining and Manufacturing, Co.</a></p>
