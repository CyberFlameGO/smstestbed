	Manufacturing, and Inspection Data for a Box Assembly</h1>

	<p>To better understand and address the challenges faced in linking all stages
	of a manufacturing and design process, an investigative fabrication process was
	designed and enacted as part of a collaboration between <a
	href="https://www.nist.gov">National Institute of Standards and Technology
	(NIST)</a> and <a href="http://www.the-mtc.org/">Manufacturing Technology
	Centre (MTC)</a>. This collaboration sought to test selected open standards'
	ability to integrate the product-lifecycle stages of engineering design,
	manufacturing, and quality assurance through a thorough implementation of a
	small scale model-based enterprise (MBE). This dataset was generated as a
	result of the collaboration.</p>
